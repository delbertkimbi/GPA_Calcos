# GPA_Calcos
The main GPA calculator app building from my knowledge on the previous one. This involves state management with bloc/cubit, firebase authentication, dependency injection with get_it and more. The project is built from a figma design and hence making the dev process easier than before with flutter_screenutil for respondsiveness and auto_route for Navigation.
